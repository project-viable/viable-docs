Welcome to the new Project VIABLE blog!

Project VIABLE aims to build a realistic virtual lab simulation to teach students how to perform research. We are aiming to develop a complete curriculum with a verifiable track record.

Version 1 of the simulation was developed by a group of fourth-year students at the Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado Boulder. The initial simulation was built in Godot 3.5.
