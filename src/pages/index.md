# Welcome

Welcome to Project VIABLE!

This site hosts the documentation for the project.

If you're here for the first time, go [here](/guide). Do make sure to look at the class reference, not just the guides.

## Getting Started

This project is made using Godot 3.5 (the LTS version). You don't need to download that yourself because we include its executable here, to make sure everyone is using the right version and everything.

This Documentation assumes some basic familiarity with Godot. It has links to the Godot docs for things you might not have been exposed to before, but if you've never used it before you'll probably want to follow at least one basic tutorial so this all makes sense (even if you've used an engine like Unity or Unreal before. Godot does things somewhat differently).

Here's a link to the [Godot 3.5 documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/) (and if you google something related to Godot, *make sure you're on the documentation for **version 3.5***)
